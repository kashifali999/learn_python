# A number can't be used as a variable name.

original_num = 23
new_num = original_num + 7
print(new_num)

original_num = 23
num_to_be_added = 7
new_num = original_num + num_to_be_added
print(new_num)

# A variable can be used in calculating its own new value.

num = 90
num = num + 10
print(num)

# A variable can start out as one type of variable, then become another type of variable means if a variable is first assigned with string value later it can be assigned with number value.

# A variable name can't be a number but you can include numbers in a variable name as long as you don't begin the name with a number.

# 1st_prime_number = 2 [Illegal]
# prime_number_that_comes1st = 2 [legal]
